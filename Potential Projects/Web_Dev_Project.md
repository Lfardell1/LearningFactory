# Project: API Gateway with Rate Limiting

## **Program Definition**
This project involves building an API gateway using Flask or FastAPI with built-in rate limiting and authentication. The gateway will act as a middleware layer between clients and backend services, enforcing access control and preventing abuse.

---

## **Key Components**

### **Data Structures**
1. **User Credentials**: A database table or in-memory dictionary to store user authentication details (e.g., API keys or JWT tokens).

   Example:
   ```python
   user_credentials = {
       "user1": {"api_key": "abc123", "rate_limit": 100},
       "user2": {"api_key": "def456", "rate_limit": 50}
   }
   ```

2. **Request Logs**: A structure to track API requests per user for rate limiting.
   Example:
   ```python
   request_logs = {
       "user1": [timestamp1, timestamp2, ...],
       "user2": [timestamp1, timestamp2, ...]
   }
   ```

---

### **Algorithms**
1. **Authentication**:
   - Verify API keys or JWT tokens against the stored user credentials.

   Example:
   ```python
   def authenticate(api_key):
       return api_key in user_credentials
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement a sliding window or token bucket algorithm to enforce rate limits.

   Example:
   ```python
   def enforce_rate_limit(user, timestamp):
       logs = request_logs.get(user, [])
       logs = [t for t in logs if t > timestamp - 60]  # Last 60 seconds
       request_logs[user] = logs
       return len(logs) < user_credentials[user]["rate_limit"]
   ```

3. **Request Forwarding**:
   - Forward authenticated requests to the backend service.

---

## **Where to Begin**
1. **Set Up Flask/FastAPI**:
   - Create a basic API structure with endpoints.

2. **Design Data Storage**:
   - Decide on the storage mechanism for user credentials and logs (e.g., Redis for performance).

3. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Add an authentication layer to validate incoming requests.

4. **Develop Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement and test rate-limiting logic using mock requests.

---

## **Distribution**
1. **Dockerized Deployment**:
   - Create a Dockerfile for easy deployment.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Provide API documentation with examples for authentication and usage.

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit and integration tests to ensure security and functionality.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Add monitoring tools to track usage and detect anomalies.

# Project: File Upload System

## **Program Definition**
This project focuses on building a secure file upload and management system that includes malware scanning and access control.

---

## **Key Components**

### **Data Structures**
1. **File Metadata**: A database table to store information about uploaded files (e.g., file name, size, upload time, user).

   Example:
   ```python
   file_metadata = {
       "file_id": {"name": "document.pdf", "size": 1024, "uploaded_by": "user1", "timestamp": "2024-12-29"}
   }
   ```

2. **Access Control**: A structure to manage user permissions for uploaded files.

---

### **Algorithms**
1. **File Validation**:
   - Check file type, size, and content for security risks.

   Example:
   ```python
   def validate_file(file):
       allowed_types = ["pdf", "jpg", "png"]
       return file.type in allowed_types and file.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024
   ```

2. **Malware Scanning**:
   - Integrate with tools like ClamAV to scan uploaded files for malware.

   Example:
   ```python
   def scan_file(file_path):
       # Use ClamAV or similar tools
       pass
   ```

3. **Access Control**:
   - Ensure only authorized users can download or manage files.

---

## **Where to Begin**
1. **Set Up Flask/FastAPI**:
   - Create endpoints for uploading, downloading, and deleting files.

2. **Design Storage**:
   - Choose between local storage or cloud-based options like AWS S3.

3. **Implement Validation**:
   - Add file validation logic to the upload endpoint.

4. **Integrate Malware Scanner**:
   - Test integration with ClamAV or similar tools.

---

## **Distribution**
1. **Secure Deployment**:
   - Use HTTPS and secure authentication methods.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Implement support for distributed storage if needed.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear instructions for API usage and error handling.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Add tools to track file uploads and detect unusual patterns.

# Project: Domain Availability Checker

## **Program Definition**
This project involves building a tool to check the availability of domain names using WHOIS lookups and providing suggestions for alternatives.

---

## **Key Components**

### **Data Structures**
1. **Domain Query History**: A database or file to store user queries and results.

   Example:
   ```python
   query_history = [
       {"domain": "example.com", "available": True, "timestamp": "2024-12-29"}
   ]
   ```

2. **Suggestions List**: A list of alternative domain names generated based on user input.

---

### **Algorithms**
1. **WHOIS Lookup**:
   - Query domain registries to check availability.

   Example:
   ```python
   import whois

   def check_domain_availability(domain):
       try:
           result = whois.whois(domain)
           return not result.domain_name
       except:
           return True
   ```

2. **Alternative Suggestions**:
   - Generate suggestions by appending TLDs or prefixes/suffixes.

   Example:
   ```python
   def suggest_domains(base_name):
       tlds = [".com", ".net", ".org"]
       return [base_name + tld for tld in tlds]
   ```

   }
   ```

2. **Analytics**: A structure to track click data for shortened URLs.

---

### **Algorithms**

   ```

2. **Redirection**:
   - Redirect requests from shortened URLs to the original ones.

   Example:
   ```python
   def redirect(slug):
       return url_mappings.get(slug, {}).get("original_url")
   ```

3. **Analytics Tracking**:
