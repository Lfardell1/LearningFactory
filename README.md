## Vulnerability Simulations

### Host Vulnerable Apps
Include intentionally vulnerable applications like **OWASP Juice Shop** or **DVWA** directly in this repository. These applications are great for practicing security testing techniques and learning how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

#### Example Activity
- **Objective:** Exploit and then patch an SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Steps:**
  1. Set up the vulnerable app by following the provided instructions.
  2. Identify an SQL injection vulnerability in the app.
  3. Exploit the vulnerability to understand the impact.
  4. Apply a fix (e.g., parameterized queries) to patch the issue.
  5. Verify the fix to ensure the vulnerability is resolved.

---

### Custom Vulnerable Applications
Develop simple, custom web applications with deliberate vulnerabilities for users to discover, exploit, and secure. These custom apps provide hands-on experience in a controlled environment.

#### Example: Python Flask Application with Broken Authentication
- **Objective:** Identify and fix a broken authentication flaw.
- **Details:**
  1. A Flask web app is provided with weak authentication logic.
  2. Users are tasked with:
     - Analyzing the code to identify the flaw.
     - Exploiting the vulnerability to bypass authentication.
     - Implementing a secure authentication mechanism.
  3. After applying the fix, users test the app to confirm the issue is resolved.

#### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the vulnerable app folder (e.g., `vulnerable-apps/flask-broken-auth`).
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` file inside the app directory.
4. Begin exploring and patching the vulnerabilities.

### Notes
- These activities are for **educational purposes only**. Always use them in isolated or controlled environments to prevent unintended consequences.
- Refer to the documentation provided in each app's folder for detailed setup and usage instructions.
