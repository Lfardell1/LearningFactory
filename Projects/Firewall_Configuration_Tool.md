   # Project: Firewall Configuration Tool

   ## **Program Definition**
   This project aims to automate the configuration of firewall rules using `iptables` or `ufw` on Linux systems. The script will allow users to define inbound and outbound rules, specify protocols, and save configurations for reuse.

   ---

   ## **Key Components**

   ### **Data Structures**
   1. **Rule Definition**: A list of dictionaries to store firewall rules. Each dictionary will include:
      - `protocol`: (e.g., TCP/UDP)
      - `source`: Source IP address/range
      - `destination`: Destination IP address/range
      - `port`: Port number(s)
      - `action`: Allow or deny

      Example:
      ```python
      firewall_rules = [
          {"protocol": "tcp", "source": "192.168.1.0/24", "destination": "0.0.0.0/0", "port": "22", "action": "allow"}
      ]
      ```

   2. **Log Storage**: A list or file to maintain logs of applied configurations and any errors.

   ---

   ### **Algorithms**
   1. **Rule Validation**:
      - Ensure rules are syntactically correct (valid IPs, ports, and actions).
      - Check for conflicts with existing rules.

      Example:
      ```python
      def validate_rule(rule):
          # Validate IP, port, and action
          pass
      ```

   2. **Rule Application**:
      - Translate the rules into `iptables` or `ufw` commands.
      - Execute commands using subprocess.

      Example:
      ```python
      def apply_rules(rules):
          for rule in rules:
              command = f"iptables -A INPUT -p {rule['protocol']} --dport {rule['port']} -j {rule['action'].upper()}"
              # Execute command
      ```

   3. **Error Handling**:
      - Capture and log errors during rule application.

   ## **Where to Begin**
   1. **Understand iptables/ufw Syntax**:
      - Research basic commands and structure for these tools.

   2. **Define Rule Schema**:
      - Identify the minimal data required for defining a rule.

   3. **Develop Validation Functions**:
      - Write small functions to validate IPs, ports, and other inputs.

   4. **Testing Framework**:
      - Create a test suite to simulate rule application on a virtual machine or test environment.

   ## **Distribution**
   1. **Command-Line Tool**:
      - Package the script as a CLI utility using Python libraries like `argparse` or `click`.

   2. **Documentation**:
      - Provide a README with usage instructions, example commands, and troubleshooting steps.

   3. **Version Control**:
      - Use Git for version tracking and GitHub for distribution.

   4. **Deployment**:
      - Package the tool using `pyinstaller` for standalone distribution.

   # Project: Data Integrity Verifier

   ## **Program Definition**
   This project will verify the integrity of files by comparing their hash values against a given standard or previously recorded hash. Supported algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

   ---

   ## **Key Components**

   ### **Data Structures**
   1. **Hash Record**: A dictionary to store file paths and their corresponding hash values.

      Example:
      ```python
      hash_records = {
          "file1.txt": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
          "file2.jpg": "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
      }
      ```

   2. **Log Storage**: A file or list to store mismatched hash results.

   ---

   ### **Algorithms**
   1. **Hash Calculation**:
      - Compute the hash value of a file using the specified algorithm.

          import hashlib
          hash_func = getattr(hashlib, algorithm)
          with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
              return hash_func(f.read()).hexdigest()
      ```

   2. **Hash Comparison**:
      - Compare the calculated hash value to the stored value.

      Example:
      ```python
      def verify_integrity(file_path, expected_hash, algorithm="sha256"):
          return calculate_hash(file_path, algorithm) == expected_hash
      ```

   3. **Batch Verification**:

   # Project: Log Rotation and Archiving Script

   ## **Program Definition**
   This project focuses on automating the rotation, compression, and archiving of system logs to free up disk space and improve system performance.

   ---

   ## **Key Components**

   ### **Data Structures**
   1. **Log Metadata**: A dictionary to store log file paths and their rotation configurations (e.g., size limits, archive location).

      Example:
      ```python
      log_config = {
          "/var/log/syslog": {"size_limit": 10, "archive_path": "/backup/logs"},
          "/var/log/auth.log": {"size_limit": 5, "archive_path": "/backup/logs"}
      }
      ```

   2. **Rotation Records**: A list or file to track rotated logs and their archive locations.

   ---

   ### **Algorithms**
   1. **Log Size Checking**:
      - Monitor the size of each log file and determine if rotation is needed.

      Example:
      ```python
      import os

      def check_log_size(file_path, size_limit):
          return os.path.getsize(file_path) > size_limit * 1024 * 1024
      ```

   2. **Compression and Archiving**:
      - Compress logs using `gzip` and move them to the archive directory.

   3. **Rotation Execution**:
      - Rename the current log file and create a new one.

      Example:
      ```python
      def rotate_log(file_path):
          os.rename(file_path, f"{file_path}.1")
      ```

   ---

   ## **Where to Begin**
