# Networking Topics & Projects

Below is a **Markdown** version of the outline covering key networking topics and associated programming projects. Adjust scope and complexity as needed for your learners.

## 1. Networking Topics to Cover

1. **Basic Networking Models**  
   - OSI model (7 layers) vs. TCP/IP model  
   - Protocols at each layer (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP, etc.)  

2. **IP Addressing & Subnetting**  
   - IPv4 vs. IPv6  
   - Subnet masks, CIDR notation  
   - Private vs. public IP addresses  

3. **Routing & Switching**  
   - Role of routers and switches  
   - Default gateways, routing tables  

4. **Transport Layer Protocols**  
   - TCP vs. UDP  
   - Connection-oriented vs. connectionless communications  
   - Ports and sockets  

5. **Domain Name System (DNS)**  
   - DNS hierarchy (root, TLDs, domain)  
   - A vs. AAAA records, CNAME, MX, etc.  
   - Forward vs. reverse DNS lookups  

6. **Application Layer Protocols**  
   - HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, SSH, etc.  
   - RESTful APIs and JSON over HTTP  

7. **Network Services & Configuration**  
   - DHCP (automatic IP assignment)  
   - NAT (Network Address Translation)  
   - VPN basics  

8. **Security Basics**  
   - Firewalls, proxies  
   - SSL/TLS, HTTPS, encryption fundamentals  
   - Common attacks (DDoS, phishing, etc.)  

9. **Socket Programming**  
   - Client-server architecture  
   - TCP and UDP socket creation  
   - Handling multiple connections  

10. **Performance & Monitoring**  
    - Bandwidth, latency, jitter  
    - Tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`

## 2. Programming Projects to Apply These Ideas

Below are **20 project suggestions** to help students practice these concepts in code. You can use any programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++, Go).

1. **TCP Chat Server & Client**  
   - Create a server that multiple clients can connect to.  
   - Use TCP sockets, handle user messages, broadcast to other clients.  

2. **UDP “Ping-Pong” Messenger**  
   - Implement a simple client and server that exchange text using UDP.  
   - Observe packet loss and discuss why UDP is connectionless.  

3. **Custom Web Server**  
   - Build a basic HTTP server that serves static HTML pages.  
   - Discuss HTTP request/response format and status codes.  

4. **HTTP Client**  
   - Create a program that sends HTTP GET/POST requests to a server.  
   - Parse and display the returned data.  

5. **DNS Resolver**  
   - Implement a simple DNS lookup tool that sends queries to a DNS server.  
   - Parse the DNS response to show domain-to-IP mappings.  

6. **Network Sniffer (Packet Capture)**  
   - Use a library (e.g., `pcapy`, `libpcap`) to capture and parse network traffic.  
   - Show TCP/UDP packet headers and relevant fields.  

7. **Port Scanner**  
   - Scan specified IP addresses for open ports (TCP or UDP).  
   - Teach about SYN scans, FIN scans, and well-known ports.  

8. **Multi-threaded File Transfer Service**  
   - Implement a server that can handle file uploads/downloads concurrently from multiple clients.  
   - Explore concurrency and TCP flow control.  

9. **Load Balancer Simulation**  
   - Create a simple TCP-based load balancer that distributes incoming requests to multiple backend servers.  
   - Focus on round-robin or least-connection algorithms.  

10. **DHCP-like Service**  
    - Implement a minimal DHCP server and client.  
    - Have the server assign IP addresses from a small pool.  

11. **NAT Simulator**  
    - Simulate a basic NAT mechanism on your local machine.  
    - Track translations from internal IPs/ports to external IPs/ports.  

12. **SSH/Telnet Client**  
    - Build a simplified Telnet-like client or use encryption libraries for SSH.  
    - Emphasize remote command execution and security considerations.  

13. **SMTP Email Client**  
    - Implement the SMTP protocol to send emails from your client to a mail server.  
    - Optionally parse responses and handle common error codes.  

14. **WebSocket Chat Application**  
    - Explore real-time communication using WebSockets.  
    - Compare it with traditional TCP/UDP socket approaches.  

15. **Traceroute Implementation**  
    - Implement traceroute functionality by manipulating TTL (Time To Live) in IP headers.  
    - Observe routing paths and intermediate hops.  

16. **Proxy Server**  
    - Write a simple HTTP proxy server that forwards requests and caches responses.  
    - Discuss caching, filtering, or logging traffic.  

17. **Bandwidth & Latency Tester**  
    - Implement a tool that measures throughput and round-trip time to a server.  
    - Analyze results and demonstrate how network quality can be measured.  

18. **VPN Conceptual Demo**  
    - Create a simple program that encrypts traffic on one side, sends it to another side, and decrypts.  
    - Discuss tunnel vs. transport encryption.  

19. **RESTful API & Client**  
    - Develop a small REST API (e.g., in Flask or Node.js) and build a client to consume it.  
    - Focus on HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and JSON data.  

20. **IoT-Simulated Sensor Network**  
    - Simulate sensors sending data (UDP or TCP) to a central server.  
    - Parse data on the server, store results, visualize them (e.g., web dashboard).
