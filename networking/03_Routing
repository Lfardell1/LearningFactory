
### Overview

Routing and switching are critical functions in network infrastructure, responsible for directing data traffic efficiently and effectively.

### Switching

**Switches** operate at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model, facilitating communication within the same network.

#### Functions of a Switch

1. **MAC Address Learning:**
   - Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices by inspecting incoming frames.
   
2. **Frame Forwarding:**
   - Frames are forwarded only to the specific port where the destination device is connected, reducing unnecessary traffic.

3. **Loop Prevention:**
   - Protocols like **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** prevent network loops that can cause broadcast storms.

#### Types of Switches

- **Unmanaged Switches:**
  - Plug-and-play devices with no configuration.
  - Suitable for small networks.
  
- **Managed Switches:**
  - Offer advanced features like VLANs, QoS, and SNMP monitoring.
  - Suitable for larger, more complex networks.

#### VLANs (Virtual LANs)

- **Purpose:** Segment a physical network into multiple logical networks.
- **Benefits:** Enhances security, reduces broadcast domains, improves traffic management.
- **Configuration:** Assign ports to specific VLANs; inter-VLAN routing requires a router or Layer 3 switch.

### Routing

**Routers** operate at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model, directing data packets between different networks.

#### Functions of a Router

1. **Path Selection:**
   - Determines the best path for data packets based on routing algorithms and protocols.

2. **Packet Forwarding:**
   - Forwards packets from the source to the destination network.

3. **Inter-Network Communication:**
   - Connects different network segments, enabling communication between them.

4. **Network Address Translation (NAT):**
   - Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for Internet communication.

#### Types of Routers

- **Core Routers:**
  - High-capacity routers used within the backbone of the Internet.
  
- **Edge Routers:**
  - Connect internal networks to external networks (e.g., Internet).
  
- **Virtual Routers:**
  - Software-based routers running on virtual machines or cloud environments.

### Routing Tables

A **routing table** stores routes to particular network destinations, facilitating efficient packet forwarding.

#### Components of a Routing Table

1. **Destination Network:** The target network or IP address range.
2. **Subnet Mask:** Defines the network portion of the destination.
3. **Next Hop:** The next router to forward the packet to.
4. **Interface:** The router interface to use for forwarding.
5. **Metric:** A value that represents the cost of using the route (used for path selection).

#### Static vs. Dynamic Routing

- **Static Routing:**
  - Manually configured routes.
  - Suitable for small or simple networks.
  - **Pros:** Simple, low overhead.
  - **Cons:** Not scalable, lacks adaptability.

- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - Routes are automatically learned and updated using routing protocols.
  - Suitable for larger, complex networks.
  - **Pros:** Scalable, adaptable to network changes.
  - **Cons:** More complex, higher overhead.

### Common Routing Protocols

1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**
   - **Type:** Distance-vector.
   - **Metric:** Hop count.
   - **Limitations:** Maximum of 15 hops; slow convergence.

2. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**
   - **Type:** Link-state.
   - **Metric:** Cost based on bandwidth.
   - **Advantages:** Fast convergence, scalable.

3. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):**
   - **Type:** Advanced distance-vector.
   - **Metric:** Bandwidth, delay, load, reliability.
   - **Advantages:** Fast convergence, supports VLSM/CIDR.

4. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**
   - **Type:** Path-vector.
   - **Metric:** AS path, policy-based attributes.
   - **Usage:** Core routing protocol of the Internet.

### Practical Example: Configuring OSPF

**Scenario:** Configure OSPF on two routers to enable communication between them.

**Router A Configuration:**

```bash
RouterA# configure terminal
RouterA(config)# router ospf 1
RouterA(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
RouterA(config-router)# exit
RouterA(config)# exit
RouterA# write memory

RouterB# configure terminal
RouterB(config)# router ospf 1
RouterB(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
RouterB(config-router)# exit
RouterB(config)# exit
RouterB# write memory

```
